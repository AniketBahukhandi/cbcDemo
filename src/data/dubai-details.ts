Upon entering, students and visitors are greeted with a layout that encourages them to engage with a variety of environments. Its interiors transcend traditional academic boundaries, fluidly connecting private learning spaces with communal areas. Throughout the campus, a consistent theme of simple, linear forms combined with multifaceted geometric patterns of the Middle Eastern world prevails, echoing the Bauhaus principle of blending functionality with aesthetics. This design choice is a nod to the fusion of German architectural simplicity and Arab artistic intricacy, creating a holistic environment where every element contributes to a story of cultural and educational synergy.",
